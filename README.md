**About the Dataset**

This dataset was compiled using data sourced from FRED.

The inspiration to create this dataset came while I was reading the research paper titled "Factors Affecting House Prices in Cyprus: 1988-2008" by Panos Pashardes & Christos S. Savva. This paper offers deep insights into the macroeconomic factors influencing the real estate market. 

*General Definitions:*

Macroeconomic Factors:

    House_Price_Index: Reflects changes in house prices, relative to a base period index (check for the date when this value is 100).
    
    Stock_Price_Index: Indicates stock price fluctuations relative to a base period index (check for the date when this value is 100).
    
    Consumer_Price_Index (CPI): Measures overall changes in consumer prices over time based on a representative basket of goods and services.
    
    Population: Population of the USA, measured in thousands.
    
    Unemployment_Rate: Unemployment rate in the USA, expressed as a percentage.
    
    Real_GDP: GDP adjusted for inflation. The annual version is in billions of chain 2012 dollars, while the monthly version shows annualized change.
    
    Mortgage_Rate: The interest rate charged on mortgages, expressed as a percentage.
    
    Real_Disposable_Income (Real Disposable Personal Income): The amount of income remaining after taxes, measured in billions of chain 2012 dollars.
    
    Inflation: Represents the decline in purchasing power over time, expressed as a percentage. Note: This column was accidentally left in the annual version since CPI is one of the measures used to determine inflation.
